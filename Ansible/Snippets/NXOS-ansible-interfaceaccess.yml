# This routine executes provisioning of a single interface
#
# The Playbook is executed with all runtime variables passed to it, including the inventory: 
# ansible-playbook -i "10.1.1.1," NXOS-ansible-interfaceaccess.yml --extra-vars="username=admin password=juju interface=Ethernet1/1 vlan=20 description='Configured by Ansible'"
#
# Note that the inventory is passed within "" and includes a trailing comma. The trailing comma is important
# as it differentiates a list of devices or hostname vs an inventory file. Also note the description where
# spaces can be processed within a variable

  # The Configuration task is broken down into two tasks. The Physical Interface configuration task where
  # the NX device is connected and the interface (passed from the interface variable) is configured as a 
  # switchport, and no shut. The secon task puts uses the switchport module to put the port into mode access
  # and assign the vlan to the access port.
