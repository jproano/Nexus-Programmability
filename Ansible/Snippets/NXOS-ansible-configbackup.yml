# This routine executes a backup of the running configuration of a network device
# 
# The Module is executed along with an inventory file with a [nxos] header and IPs or HN or FQDNs under it,
# the example file. The inventory file doesnt have to have an extension but wont break if one is there.
#
# The Playbook is executed with two runtime variables passed to it: 
# ansible-playbook -i device-inventory NXOS-ansible-configbackup.yml --extra-vars="username=admin password=juju"
# Note that variables passed at run time are seperated with spaces
#

  # Dont bother with fact computation about remote entities wont need that for the simple plays being run

  # Use Username and Password provided at runtime combined with the hostname list to run in the task
  # there are alot of ways to pass username and password creds and hosts. But this way allows for the use
  # of an inventory file. This could easily be replaced with "{{ hostname }}" and a third variable can be
  # used at runtime

  # Use the nxos_config module to run a backup of the running config this task will be performed on the 
  # host(s) provided in the inventory file combined with the credentials provided at runtime.
